## Troubleshooting

### Client not sending reports
1. Check `appsettings.json` sink configuration
2. Verify network connectivity to API or Azure Storage
3. Review client logs (console or Windows Event Log if configured)
4. Confirm `.NET Framework 4.8` runtime installed
5. Ensure PowerShell 5.0+ with SecureBoot module (for certificate enumeration)
6. Run as Administrator to access registry and UEFI variables

### API ingestion failures
1. Check SQL connection string and firewall rules
2. Review API logs via Application Insights or `dotnet run` console
3. Validate EF migrations applied: `dotnet ef migrations list`
4. Test health endpoint: `GET /health`
5. Verify queue processor is running (if using Azure Queue)
6. Check SignalR hub accessibility: `WS /dashboardHub`

### Missing data in dashboard
1. Confirm API is reachable from web app
2. Check `ApiBaseUrl` setting in web app configuration
3. Verify reports exist in database: query `SecureBootReports` table
4. Review web app logs for HTTP errors
5. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
6. Verify SignalR connection in browser dev tools

### SignalR not working
1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Verify SignalR hub endpoint: `wss://yourhost/dashboardHub`
3. Ensure WebSocket support in browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
4. Check network allows WebSocket connections (port 443 for WSS)
5. Review API logs for SignalR broadcast errors
6. Test connection: `Ping()` method in browser dev tools

### Export failures
1. Verify export endpoints are accessible
2. Check API logs for export service errors
3. Ensure sufficient memory for large datasets
4. Test with small dataset first
5. Review browser download settings

### Certificate enumeration issues
1. Verify Secure Boot is enabled: `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`
2. Check PowerShell version: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` (requires 5.0+)
3. Ensure SecureBoot module is available: `Get-Module -ListAvailable SecureBoot`
4. Run PowerShell as Administrator
5. Review client logs for certificate-related errors

### Command execution issues
1. Verify commands are enabled in client configuration
2. Check client has Administrator privileges
3. Review command execution logs in client output
4. Verify command status in dashboard Command History
5. Check registry write permissions
6. Ensure client is polling for commands regularly

### Batch command failures
1. Review failed device list in batch result
2. Check individual device connectivity
3. Verify all target devices are registered
4. Review command parameters for errors
5. Check API logs for batch operation errors
6. Retry failed devices individually
